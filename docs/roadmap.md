## Bug fixes

### Fix: SPL parameter mislabeling (LidOffset / ShowerArmOffset)

**⚠️ PREREQUISITE before changing the bridge**: capture Geberit Home v2.14.1 OTA via
PacketLogger on Mera Comfort. Verify whether the app requests SPL indices 12 and 13
for the same data as v2.13.2 (UnpostedShowerCycles + DaysUntilNextDescale), or whether
v2.14.1 requests different indices for LidOffset/ShowerArmOffset (~104/105).
Do not change the SPL list until this capture confirms the mapping.

**Root cause**: `SPL_PARAMS_MERA_COMFORT = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,12,13]` is queried correctly,
but the bridge mislabels the results:
- `data_array[8]` (SPL index 12) = `AC_STATUS_UNPOSTED_SHOWER_CYCLES` — labeled `LidOffsetPosition`
- `data_array[9]` (SPL index 13) = `AC_STATUS_DAYS_UNTIL_NEXT_DESCALE` — labeled `ShowerArmOffsetPosition`

The real `LidOffsetPosition`/`ShowerArmOffsetPosition` are at SPL indices 104/105 (DpIds 65700/65701),
not currently queried. The correctly-labeled data is already available via `GetStatisticsDescale` (proc 0x51).

**Fix steps** (after v2.14.1 OTA capture confirms):
1. Remove indices 12 and 13 from `SPL_PARAMS_MERA_COMFORT` → back to `[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]`
   (GetStatisticsDescale already provides the same data with correct names)
2. Remove `LidOffsetPosition`/`ShowerArmOffsetPosition` from `DeviceStateChangedEventArgs` (`IAquaCleanClient.py`)
3. Remove from `device_state` SPL update path (`main.py` ~lines 2970–2981)
4. Remove from coordinator SPL result mapping (`coordinator.py` ~lines 592–619)
5. Remove two HACS sensors with wrong data: `lid_offset_position`, `shower_arm_offset_position` (`sensor.py`)
6. Update bridge comments in `AquaCleanClient.py` and `coordinator.py`

## Protocol / BLE

### Add SPL indices 14–22 to bridge

All confirmed safe from firmware analysis (node 0x01 dispatcher handles 0–21) and iOS app DpId.cs.
Indices 16, 17, 20, 21 are not yet exposed anywhere — add to bridge and expose via REST/MQTT/HACS.

| Index | Name | Bridge currently provides via |
|-------|------|-------------------------------|
| 14 | DaysUntilShowerRestricted | GetStatisticsDescale — redundant if added to SPL |
| 15 | ShowerCyclesUntilConfirmation | GetStatisticsDescale — redundant if added to SPL |
| 16 | TimestampAtLastDescale | **not yet exposed** |
| 17 | TimestampAtLastDescalePrompt | **not yet exposed** |
| 18 | NumberOfDescaleCycles | GetStatisticsDescale — redundant if added to SPL |
| 19 | DaysUntilNextFilterChange | GetFilterStatus — redundant if added to SPL |
| 20 | TimestampAtLastFilterChange | **not yet exposed** |
| 21 | TimestampAtLastFilterChangePrompt | **not yet exposed** |
| 22 | NumberOfFilterChanges | GetFilterStatus — redundant if added to SPL |

---

### Implement `SetActiveProfileSetting` (proc 0x08)

Wire format confirmed from OTA capture (2026-06-01): `[arg_count=3, setting_id, value]`.
Examples: `[3, 4, 2]` = set AnalShowerPosition to 2; `[3, 2, 2]` = set AnalShowerPressure to 2.
Applies settings live (in-session); proc 0x54 persists to flash.
Wire CallClass first, then expose via REST/MQTT.

---

### Wire remaining unimplemented procedures

| Proc | Name | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| `0x06` | GetActualOutletTemperature | Not yet in bridge; trigger: start shower and sniff |
| `0x07` | Per-node profile setting query | Wire format: `[node_id]` — 1-byte arg |
| `0x51` | GetStoredCommonSetting(id) → 2-byte int | High priority; bridges to CommonSetting IDs 4–12 |
| `0x56` | SetDeviceRegistrationLevel(int) | Low priority; purpose unclear |

---

### Add CommonSetting IDs 4–12 to bridge

Confirmed from iOS app v2.14.1. Fix ID 0 label (`OdourRunOn` → `WaterHardness`).
Add IDs 4–12 to bridge read sequence and expose via REST/MQTT/HACS.
See `.claude/rules/ble-protocol.md` for the full CommonSetting ID table.

---

### Add ProfileSetting IDs 11–14 to bridge

Confirmed from iOS app v2.14.1:
IDs 11 (SeatHeating), 12 (WaterHeating), 13 (DryerFanPower, 5 levels), 14 (LadyOscillation).
Add to `ProfileSettings.py` enum. Add getters to `AquaCleanClient`; expose via REST/CLI.

---

### Wire AcSela-specific features: StateOrientationLight, ConnectedSsmDevices, ToggleOrientationLight

Requested in [issue #27](https://github.com/jens62/geberit-aquaclean/issues/27#issuecomment-4642370701).
All three are **AcSela only** — must be guarded by model detection (see "HACS: model-aware entity visibility").

| Feature | Protocol | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `StateOrientationLight` | SPL index 9 | Live on/off state; **⚠️ DO NOT query on Mera Comfort** — permanently corrupts `GetFilterStatus` until power-cycle |
| `ConnectedSsmDevices` | SPL index 100 | Bitmask: bit0=FlushTrigger, bit1=OdourExtraction, bit2=OrientationLight; AcSela fw≥4 / AcMeraComfort fw≥23 |
| `ToggleOrientationLight` | `SetCommand` code 20 | Toggle on/off; **AcSela ONLY** — confirmed from factory source; does NOT work on Mera Comfort |

Implementation order:
1. Add SPL index 9 to `SPL_PARAMS_ACSELA` (separate list from `SPL_PARAMS_MERA_COMFORT`)
2. Add SPL index 100 to AcSela + AcMeraComfort fw≥23 lists
3. Wire `ToggleOrientationLight` (SetCommand 20) to REST/MQTT/HACS behind model guard
4. Expose `StateOrientationLight` and `ConnectedSsmDevices` as HACS sensors (AcSela only)

---

### Wire remaining Commands enum entries (all interfaces)

(Stop, OdourExtraction, OdourExtractionRunOn done in v3.0.6. ToggleOrientationLight moved to AcSela task above.)

---

### BLE sniffing needed — unimplemented procedures

When asked "What should I sniff?", start here:

| Proc | Name | What to trigger | What to look for |
|------|------|-----------------|------------------|
| `0x08` | SetActiveProfileSetting | Change a profile setting during active shower | Outgoing write to WRITE_0/WRITE_1 after slider moves |
| `0x56` | SetDeviceRegistrationLevel | App startup / first connect | Any outgoing ctx=0x01 proc=0x56 write |

Tools: `tools/ble-session-replay.py --dry-run` to verify proc appears in captured log.
`tools/geberit-ble-probe.py --proc 0xNN` to test candidate payload on live device.

---

### nRF52840 passive sniff of remote control BLE traffic

**Goal:** discover procedure codes and SetCommand codes the phone app never sends.
The physical remote control (`b0:10:a0:68:5c:8b`) connects to the toilet independently
and may use remote-only procedures not visible in any app capture.

**Method:** nRF52840 dongle in Wireshark passive-sniffer mode (REQ_FOLLOW).
**Do NOT attempt direct serial / REQ_FOLLOW via Python** — `tools/archive/sniff.py` is
archived; REQ_FOLLOW does not work with nrfutil v4.x firmware. Only the Wireshark path works.
Operate the remote normally during capture, then analyse ATT Write frames with
`tools/find-geberit-remote.py <capture.pcapng>`. Compare against `.claude/rules/ble-protocol.md`.

See `docs/developer/protocol-discovery.md` for full context.

## Performance

### Reduce poll query time from ~2.7 s to ~0.5 s

Profiled from TRACE log 2026-04-23. Steady-state poll breakdown after v3.0.9:

| Phase | Time | Every poll? | iPhone does this? |
|-------|------|-------------|-------------------|
| 8× SubscribeNotifications (unlock) | ~2,400 ms | Yes | No — once per app lifetime |
| 11× GetStoredProfileSettings (0x53) | ~2,200 ms | **Once per boot (cached since v3.0.9)** | No — once at session init |
| 7× GetStoredCommonSettings (0x51) | ~1,400 ms | **Once per boot (cached since v3.0.9)** | No — once at session init |
| GetSystemParameterList | ~410 ms | Yes | Yes |
| BLE connect + wait_for_info_frames | ~700–1,300 ms | Yes | ~150 ms |

**Fix 1** — ~~Cache GetStoredProfileSettings + GetStoredCommonSettings~~ — **Done in v3.0.9** (~3.6 s saved after first poll).
**Fix 2** — Keep BLE connection alive between polls (~2.4 s saved per poll):
do not disconnect at poll end; reconnect only on error or timeout. SubscribeNotifications
runs once at connect time and is reused across all polls until the connection drops.
Equivalent to persistent BLE mode scoped to the poll interval.
Expose as a **"Stay connected" toggle in the HACS options flow** — off by default
(on-demand is safer when BLE adapter is shared); on = persistent between polls.
**Fix 3** — Reduce GetFilterStatus timeout from 5 s to 2 s.

---

### Alba: session caching — skip KE handshake on every poll

The bridge currently does a full Arendi handshake on every poll.
The Geberit Home App does one KE per user session and stays connected.

**Benefits:**
1. **Performance**: skips 5 round trips of cryptographic operations per poll.
2. **Remote displacement fix**: reduces keyset-0 KE count from 1-per-poll to 1-per-device-boot (Hypothesis A).

**Implementation**: after a successful KE, persist session keys and counters on the coordinator
between polls. Invalidate cache when `nonce2` in EP Response changes (= device power-cycle).

**Diagnostic prerequisite before coding**: set poll interval to 3600s. If displacement moves from
~2.5 min to ~5 hours, session caching is the right fix. See `memory/alba-session-caching-fix.md`.

---

## Debugging / Observability

### SQLite change log + raw data debug panel

Goal: log every raw value change from every Geberit procedure to disk.
Schema: `sessions`, `changes`, `annotations` tables with WAL mode.
Annotation endpoint: `POST /debug/annotate` — key feature for protocol analysis.
Web UI: "Live values" tab (SSE-driven) + "Change history" tab (REST-driven).
HACS: use HA recorder instead (diagnostic sensor entities).
Implementation order: SQLite → annotation REST → live values tab → change history tab → all procs → HACS sensors → export command.

---

## HACS

### HACS custom integration (Home Assistant, no MQTT)

**Goal:** Native HA integration installable via HACS — no MQTT broker required.

**Approach:** thin `custom_components/geberit_aquaclean/` adapter in this repo.
A `DataUpdateCoordinator` calls `AquaCleanClient` directly from the existing pip package —
zero protocol code duplicated. The package remains the single source of truth for BLE comms.

BLE transport: uses `BluetoothLeConnector` directly (Option A) or HA's `bluetooth` domain
via `habluetooth` (Option B, `use_ha_bluetooth = true`). Both are implemented and shipped in v3.1.0.

Standalone bridge + MQTT path fully preserved alongside.

---

### HACS: expose cached stored settings as entities with explicit refresh

`GetStoredProfileSettings` (11 settings) and `GetStoredCommonSettings` (7 settings) are
fetched once per integration load and then cached. Their values should be visible as HACS
entities and re-queryable on demand.

**Entities to add** (all as `number` or `select` entities, DIAGNOSTIC or user-facing):
- All 11 `ProfileSettings` entries (OdourExtraction, AnalShowerPressure, WaterTemperature, …)
- All 7 `CommonSettings` entries (WaterHardness, OrientationLightBrightness, Language, …)

**Explicit refresh button:**
Add a `button` entity "Refresh cached settings" that clears `_mera_profile_settings_cache`
and `_mera_common_settings_cache` on press and triggers an immediate coordinator refresh.
This lets the user force a re-read after changing settings via the Geberit Home app (which
the bridge cannot detect automatically).

---

### HACS: detect model from BLE advertisement before first poll

**Prerequisite for all model-specific work below.**

The device model (`AcSela`, `AcMeraComfort`, `AcCama`, …) can be determined from the
**BLE advertisement manufacturer-specific data** without a GATT connection — the same
5-char article number prefix that the Geberit Home App uses at scan time.
See `docs/developer/ble-advertisement-model-detection.md` for the full lookup table and
payload format.

**Implementation:** after a BLE scan finds the device MAC (but before connecting),
parse bytes 3–7 of the manufacturer-specific data payload → article number prefix →
call `AcDeviceTypeHelper`-equivalent lookup → store result as
`coordinator.device_variant` (`"AcSela"` | `"AcMeraComfort"` | …).

This allows `async_setup_entry` to register only the correct model's entities immediately,
without waiting for a first-poll `GetDeviceIdentification` round-trip.

---

### HACS: model-aware entity visibility

Only register entities that apply to the connected device model. Currently all entities
are registered at setup regardless of which model is connected, so Mera Comfort users see
Alba-only entities (and vice versa) as unavailable clutter.

**Approach:**
- Detect the connected model from coordinator data (SAP number / device series / `is_variant_a` flag)
- Split entity lists into model-specific subsets: `ENTITIES_MERA_COMFORT`, `ENTITIES_ALBA`, `ENTITIES_ALL`
- Register only the matching subset in `async_setup_entry`; skip entities whose model
  requirement does not match the detected device

This removes grey/unavailable entities from the HA dashboard without requiring the user
to manually hide them.

---

### HACS Alba: configurable DpId polling frequency

`_ALBA_SLOW_POLL_EVERY = 10` is hardcoded.
**Option A** (recommended first): expose as user setting in options flow (~0.5 session).
**Option B** (recommended long-term): per-group frequency (live/stored/identification/statistics/descaling).

---

### HACS: poll interval slider

Add a `number` entity (or options-flow field) to control the poll interval from the HA UI
without editing `config.ini` or restarting the integration.

**Suggested entity:** `number.geberit_aquaclean_poll_interval` — range 10–3600 s, step 10 s,
DIAGNOSTIC category. Writing the entity calls `coordinator.async_set_poll_interval(value)`
which updates the in-memory interval and reschedules the next update.

---

### HACS open items

- **Config flow: validate ESPHome host field syntax** — malformed IP passes `cv.string` but fails at aioesphomeapi. Add validator for `CONF_ESPHOME_HOST`.
- **`sensor.geberit_aquaclean_ble_state`** — intra-poll BLE cycle tracking. Self-push via `async_write_ha_state()` only — do NOT call `coordinator.async_update_listeners()` mid-poll.
- **Poll countdown sensor** — `next_poll` timestamp from `poll_epoch` + `poll_interval`.
- **RSSI tracking** — add `ble_rssi` and `wifi_rssi` to PollStats and HACS coordinator.
- **Integration version sensor** — read from `manifest.json`, expose as DIAGNOSTIC entity. Also log the version as INFO in the HA log at integration startup (alongside firmware version).
- **Multilingual support (EN/DE/FR/IT)** — `strings.json` + translation files; replace `_attr_name` with `_attr_translation_key`. ~1 session.
- **Download button for Performance Statistics panel** — Option 1 (quickest): `custom:button-card` + inline JS.

---

## CLI / Setup

### Orientation Light card — richer UI in Lovelace dashboards

Replace the current plain `number` sliders for the Orientation Light card with a
purpose-built UI using HACS frontend cards:

- **Activation** — `select` entity or dropdown rendered via the existing
  `number.geberit_aquaclean_orientation_light_activation` (0=Off, 1=On, 2=When Approached)
- **Brightness** — `custom:number-box-card` with +/− buttons instead of a slider
- **Colour** — `custom:rgb-light-card` with 7 colour dots matching the seven
  `OrientationLightColour` values (Blue, Turquoise, Magenta, Orange, Yellow, WarmWhite, ColdWhite)

Prerequisites (HACS Frontend):
- `custom:number-box-card`
- `custom:rgb-light-card`

The colour entity would need a backing `light` entity or a workaround that maps the
7-value `number.geberit_aquaclean_orientation_light_color` to an `rgb_color` the card
can read and write. Options: HA template light, input_select + automation, or a custom
entity in the integration that exposes the 7 colours as a proper `light` with `color_mode`.

---

### `--scan` CLI command — BLE device discovery

**Goal:** Let users discover the Geberit's BLE MAC address without manually scanning with
external tools, as part of first-time setup.

**Usage (proposed):**
```bash
aquaclean-bridge --scan                              # local BLE adapter
aquaclean-bridge --scan --esphome-host 192.168.0.160 # via ESPHome proxy
```

**Behaviour:** scan ~10 s, filter Geberit/AC PRO devices, print MAC + RSSI table,
print ready-to-paste `config.ini` snippet, exit.

**DRY note:** scan logic in one place inside the package; CLI and `ble-scan.py` are consumers only.
Auto-select ESPHome path when `[ESPHOME] host` is set in `config.ini` or `--esphome-host` is passed.

---

## Testing / CI

### Automated tests as GitHub Actions

Investigate what can be tested without real BLE hardware and wire it into a GitHub Actions
workflow so tests run on every push.

Candidates:
- **Unit tests** — `pytest` on pure-Python logic: frame encoding/decoding (`FrameService`),
  error code formatting (`ErrorManager`), config validation (`_check_config_errors`),
  firmware version parsing (`_parse_rs_ts`, `_find_series_and_variant`).
- **Protocol tests against mock device** — run the bridge against `tools/mock-geberit-alba.py`
  (and future `mock-geberit-sela.py`) in the same CI job; assert that a full poll cycle
  completes and returns expected data shapes.
- **HACS integration smoke test** — `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` can load the
  custom component against a mocked coordinator; assert entity states without BLE.
- **Import / type check** — `python -m py_compile` on all modules + `mypy --ignore-missing-imports`
  to catch regressions without a test harness.
- **Firmware download script** — `--list` against the real Geberit cloud API (read-only,
  no credentials); assert the catalogue is non-empty and series 248 is present.

Suggested workflow file: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, triggered on push to `main` and on PRs.
Start with the cheapest tests (import check, unit tests) and add mock-device tests once the
Sela mock server exists.

---

## Code quality / Maintenance

### Refactor web UI (`static/index.html`)

`aquaclean_console_app/static/index.html` is a single monolithic file that has grown too
large to maintain. It is also feature-incomplete relative to the HACS integration.

Suggested split:
- Extract CSS into `static/style.css`
- Extract JavaScript into one or more `static/app.js` / `static/panels/*.js` files
- Break HTML into logical sections (connection, controls, descaling, filter, settings, debug)
- Bring feature parity closer to HACS: orientation light panel, odour extraction,
  firmware info, performance stats

---

### Refactor `main.py`

`aquaclean_console_app/main.py` is far too long — it contains config parsing, REST route
handlers, SSE logic, BLE orchestration, MQTT wiring, and HA discovery all in one file.

Suggested split (each becomes its own module under `aquaclean_console_app/`):
- `config.py` — config loading, validation, `_check_config_errors()`
- `ha_discovery.py` — `get_ha_discovery_configs()`, publish/remove HA discovery
- `api_handlers.py` — REST endpoint implementations (currently inline lambdas / methods on `ApiMode`)
- `service_mode.py` — `ServiceMode` class (already partially isolated; move fully)
- `api_mode.py` — `ApiMode` class

`main.py` should become a thin entry point: load config, wire services, start the event loop.

---

### Log error codes to the Python log file

When an exception is mapped to an error code in `_on_demand_inner`'s finally block,
only MQTT and SSE receive the code. Add `logger.error(f"BLE error {ec.code} — {e}")`
at the point of mapping in `main.py`.

---

### system-info: distinguish config.ini values from runtime values

`get_system_info()` reads `ble_connection`, `esphome_api_connection`, `poll_interval`
from config.ini only. Split `config` block into `from_file` and `runtime` sub-sections.
Use `ApiMode.get_system_info_data()` (already called by REST endpoint) to merge runtime values.

---

### install.sh: show progress during slow pip steps

Print "This may take several minutes on Raspberry Pi…" before each slow pip step
and add `--timeout 60` to pip commands.

---

### Entity reference doc generator for Mera Comfort

`tools/generate-hacs-entity-docs.py` covers Alba entities with Availability column but no protocol reference.
A parallel `tools/generate-mera-entity-docs.py` should generate `docs/developer/mera-entity-reference.md`
from the Mera entity lists (`BINARY_SENSORS`, `PROFILE_NUMBERS`, `COMMON_NUMBERS`, `BUTTONS`).
Column layout: Entity ID | Friendly Name | Protocol reference (e.g. `SPL index 0`, `ProfileSetting ID 2`).
See `tools/generate-hacs-entity-docs.py` for the pattern to follow.

---

### Mock alba: autonomous `DP_USER_DETECTION_STATUS` notification to enable Remote Control

After Phase 3 `Initialize()` completes, the Geberit Home App subscribes `NOTIFY_ENABLE` for
`DpId=607` (`DP_USER_DETECTION_STATUS`).  Until a notification fires with value `b'\x01'`,
the app's **Remote Control** section keeps all shower buttons disabled (user not sitting).

**Planned behaviour:** after Phase 3 Initialize() finishes, the mock starts an asyncio task
that toggles `DP_USER_DETECTION_STATUS` every 45 s:
- `b'\x01'` → user sitting → Remote Control shower buttons enabled
- `b'\x00'` → user not sitting → shower buttons disabled

**Implementation:**
- Detect Phase 3 complete: `_ble_session_phase == 3` and `_disc_sent` still False (Initialize done,
  not yet finished).  Better anchor: watch for Phase 3 KE + Inventory complete (same signal
  that sets `_ble_session_phase = 3`).
- Spawn `asyncio.create_task(_user_sitting_loop())` at that point.
- `_user_sitting_loop()`: alternates state every 45 s; on each tick sends a `NOTIFY` frame for
  DpId=607 via `send_notify` callback; stops when BLE disconnects.
- Also subscribe DpId=564 (`DP_ANAL_SHOWER_STATUS`) notification: push `b'\x01'` when
  shower would "run" (value > 0 in the sitting window), `b'\x00'` when not running.

**Why:** validates the full Remote Control UI path in the app — confirms the mock handles
the entire settings + live-control flow, not just save/registration.

---

### Mock server for AquaClean Sela — testing without real hardware

Build `tools/mock-geberit-sela.py` analogous to the existing `tools/mock-geberit-alba.py`.
Allows integration and coordinator testing without a physical Sela device.

Implementation notes:
- Reuse the Arendi/Ble20 layer from `mock-geberit-alba.py` where applicable (same BLE
  advertisement format); Sela uses AquaCleanV1 (same GATT UUIDs as Mera Comfort), not Ble2V1.
- Respond to the same GATT procedures the bridge calls: `GetSystemParameterList` (0x0D),
  `GetStoredProfileSetting` (0x53), `GetStoredCommonSetting` (0x51), `GetDeviceIdentification`
  (0x82), `GetFilterStatus` (0x59), `GetSOCApplicationVersions` (0x81),
  `GetFirmwareVersionList`, `SetCommand` (0x09).
- Use realistic Sela-specific SPL values: include SPL index 9 (StateOrientationLight) and
  SPL index 100 (ConnectedSsmDevices) in responses — both AcSela-only.
- Firmware version: RS08.0 TS57 (node 0x01) — from msperl's confirmed Sela.
- Advertise article prefix `146.22` in manufacturer-specific data so the bridge detects
  `AcSela` variant at scan time.

Consider analysing the Sela firmware before building the mock:
- Node 0x01 (`0x01_decompiled.c`, 18,739 lines) — main controller; contains SPL dispatcher,
  procedure handlers, and the CommonSetting/ProfileSetting switch tables.
- Sela-specific nodes not present in Mera Comfort: 0x0F (Durchlauferhitzer / tankless heater).
- BLE controller (node 0x00) is identical to Mera Comfort (same binary, RS10 TS18).
- Decompiled output: `local-assets/firmware/FwPkg_F806_V8.2.57.251023_0650871a_Sela_F8_06_RS_08_02_TS_57_extracted/`

### Agentic BLE protocol fuzzer

New script `tools/geberit-ble-fuzz.py` with modes:
`--mode read-procs` / `--mode setcommand` / `--mode common-settings` / `--mode profile-settings`.
Reuses `BluetoothLeConnector` + `AquaCleanClient`. Safe defaults: skip dangerous SetCommand
codes (33–36, 4, 37, 6–9) unless `--unsafe` is passed.
